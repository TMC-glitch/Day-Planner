# Day Planner

## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule I want to add important events to a daily planner
so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- I can open the planner and see the current day displayed at the top of the calendar.
- I scroll and I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- When I click into a timeblock I can enter an event, click a save button for that timeblock input and the text for that event is saved in local storage.
- When I refresh the page the saved events persist.
